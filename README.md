## Sulfate

IsoLab's R-markdown script for processing data from our Thermo Vanquish Neo HPLC (Ruby) coupled to a Thermo Orbitrap Exploris 240 Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (Ivan).

It is written in R and R-markdown and, among other packages, employs [`isoorbi`](https://isoorbi.isoverse.org/).

# History

This code started from 'CalculateDeltas.R' which was used for both nitrate and sulfate. Various subsequent names and increasing complexity (e.g., ivan.R, ivan_high_res.R, ruby.Rmd, ivanruby.Rmd).
